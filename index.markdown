# About
Enthusiastic worker seeking new opportunities within the ICT discipline. My experience in ICT extends from both a Networking and Software Enginnering background. Throughout my employment history I have proven customer service skills and areable to adapt to new environments. I pride myself on my proficiency with technology and I work well in both team and self-directed excersises and environments.

# Work Skills
Whether its reading books, scrolling through API’s or looking through other peoples work. Learning new and more efficient ways to solve a problem is a kick of dopamine that drives my passion for further development.

## Attention to Detail
From meticulously stepping through lines of code in a debugger, analyzing spreadsheets of data parsed into an application for processing or to finding new formulas, algorithms or methods to optimize solutions, I will always pick things apart to their smallest forms to understand how something works than accept that it just works.

## Multitasking
From prioritizing jobs, finishing before deadlines to general optimal organization structures, I stick to the most important task at hand and instead of tunnel visioning always try and see full scope when working on projects.

## Teamwork
Teamwork is essential in the ICT industry. Project scopes are more important than they have ever been, So it’s important that you can work in a group, but you can also handle your team even when things are less than ideal. I often find myself taking on the leadership role due to my ability to listen and communicate information to all members, and when conflict arises, resolving it immediately to stop a team from becoming jaded.

# Skills
When working on personal projects, I always try and build them in new unique ways such as a different coding languages or new design patterns. It helps me understand why certain languages are favored in certain industries such as python/javascript in machine learning. While I know I could build these in applications I am more familiar with such as C++, I find it extremely important to know when and how to use each tool that is provided to us.

### Languages known
C, C++, C#, Rust, Java, Python
