Attack on Giant is a proof of concept engine with a lightweight game that demonstrates basic AI through finite state machine, animation, scriptable language (lua) from a compiled engine (C++). It also features dynamic terrain, simple Phong lighting and some other cool features.

This work was carried out by my two teammates and myself.
